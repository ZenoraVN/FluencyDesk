  "overallFeedback": "The essay presents a clear stance and attempts to support it with reasons and examples. However, the argument lacks depth, and the language contains numerous errors, affecting clarity and coherence. The structure is generally present, but the paragraphing could be more sophisticated to fully develop the points raised. The lexical resource is limited, and grammatical errors are frequent. Overall, the essay demonstrates a basic understanding of the task but requires significant improvement in language accuracy and argumentation.",
  "TRFeedback": "The essay addresses the prompt and presents a clear position. However, the supporting arguments are somewhat generic and lack specific examples or detailed explanations. The counter-argument is acknowledged but not fully explored. To improve, the essay could benefit from more nuanced analysis and stronger evidence to support its claims.",
  "CCFeedback": "The essay generally follows a logical structure, with an introduction, body paragraphs, and conclusion. However, the transitions between ideas and paragraphs are not always smooth, and the connections between the points could be clearer. The final paragraph adds points that should have been developed in the body, affecting cohesion.",
  "LRFeedback": "The essay demonstrates a limited range of vocabulary. Word choices are often basic and occasionally inaccurate. There is a lack of sophisticated language and collocations. To improve, the essay could benefit from using a wider range of vocabulary and more precise language.",
  "GRAFeedback": "The essay contains numerous grammatical errors, including errors in subject-verb agreement, verb tense, articles, and spelling. These errors significantly impact the clarity and readability of the essay. To improve, the essay needs careful proofreading and attention to grammatical accuracy."
