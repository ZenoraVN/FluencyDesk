  "annotatedText": "In recent <ERR id=\"1\" type=\"word-level spelling\">yearss</ERR> <ERR id=\"2\" type=\"word-level grammar\">there is growing debates</ERR> about whether unpaid community <ERR id=\"3\" type=\"word-level spelling\">servise</ERR> such as volunteering helping <ERR id=\"4\" type=\"word-level spelling\">eldery</ERR>, or cleaning public areas should be <ERR id=\"5\" type=\"word-level spelling\">mandetory</ERR> part of high school education. While some <ERR id=\"6\" type=\"word-level grammar\">peoples</ERR> argue <ERR id=\"7\" type=\"word-level grammar\">it optional</ERR>, I strongly agree <ERR id=\"9\" type=\"word-level grammar\">integrate</ERR> community service into school <ERR id=\"8\" type=\"word-level spelling\">programms</ERR> offers significant educational and <ERR id=\"10\" type=\"word-level grammar\">social benefit</ERR> for students and <ERR id=\"11\" type=\"word-level grammar\">society as whole</ERR>.\n\n<ERR id=\"12\" type=\"word-level spelling\">Firstty</ERR>, mandatory community service equip students with essential <ERR id=\"13\" type=\"word-level grammar\">lifes skills</ERR> that <ERR id=\"14\" type=\"word-level grammar\">academical</ERR> subjects often overlook. <ERR id=\"15\" type=\"word-level grammar\">Participating in voluntar work</ERR> foster empathy, teamwork <ERR id=\"16\" type=\"word-level spelling\">comunication</ERR> and a sense of responsibility. For instance, helping at a shelter or organising local clean up <ERR id=\"17\" type=\"word-level spelling\">campains</ERR> expose students to real world problmes and encourages <ERR id=\"18\" type=\"word-level grammar\">them take</ERR> initiative. These experiences not only <ERR id=\"19\" type=\"word-level grammar\">make students</ERR> more well rounded individuals but also <ERR id=\"20\" type=\"word-level grammar\">prepare they</ERR> better for the challenges of adult life.\n\n<ERR id=\"21\" type=\"word-level grammar\">Opponents might argued</ERR> that forcing students to volunteer could lead them to resentment and superficial engagement. However with proper planning and <ERR id=\"22\" type=\"word-level grammar\">guidenc</ERR>, schools can design <ERR id=\"23\" type=\"word-level grammar\">programs match</ERR> students interest and strengths. For example, a student passionate about animals could <ERR id=\"24\" type=\"word-level grammar\">volunteers</ERR> at rescue centre, while another interested in education could help <ERR id=\"25\" type=\"word-level spelling\">tutter</ERR> younger children. When students see the value in what they are doing, motivation naturally follows.\n\nIn conclusion, i firmely believe incorporating community service into <ERR id=\"26\" type=\"word-level spelling\">highschool</ERR> <ERR id=\"27\" type=\"word-level spelling\">programmes</ERR> bring numerous longterm benefits. <ERR id=\"28\" type=\"word-level grammar\">It help develop</ERR> essential <ERR id=\"29\" type=\"word-level spelling\">lifeskills</ERR>, foster civic responsibility and promote a strong connection between youth and society. <ERR id=\"30\" type=\"sentence-level grammar\">Rather than viewing it as burden, we should see it as an investement in building a more compassionate and engaged generation.</ERR> Furthermore, this policy cultivates leadership and interpersonal skills.\nIt also improves critical thinking abilities.\nMoreover, it encourages time management and problem-solving skills.",
  "overallFeedback": "The essay presents a clear position and provides relevant arguments to support the idea of mandatory community service in high school programs. However, the essay contains numerous grammatical and spelling errors that affect clarity. The coherence and cohesion are adequate but could be improved with stronger transitions between ideas. The lexical resource is sufficient but could be more precise. The essay demonstrates a basic understanding of the prompt but needs significant improvement in grammatical accuracy to achieve a higher score.",
  "TRFeedback": "The response addresses the prompt and presents a clear position. The main points are relevant and support the argument.",
  "CCFeedback": "The essay is generally coherent, but the connections between some ideas could be clearer. Transitions between paragraphs are present but could be stronger.",
  "LRFeedback": "The lexical resource is adequate but could be improved with more sophisticated vocabulary and precise word choices.",
  "GRAFeedback": "The essay contains numerous grammatical and spelling errors that affect the clarity and coherence of the writing. Grammatical accuracy needs significant improvement."
