  "overallComment": "The essay addresses the topic and presents a clear position. The organization is logical, and the ideas are generally understandable. However, the language contains noticeable errors that sometimes impede communication. Vocabulary is adequate but lacks sophistication. Grammatical errors are frequent and affect clarity.",
  "taskAchievement": "The essay addresses the prompt and expresses a clear opinion. The main points are relevant to the topic, but could be further developed with more specific examples and evidence. The response demonstrates an understanding of the issues, but a more nuanced discussion would improve the score.",
  "coherenceCohesion": "The essay is logically organized with a clear introduction, body paragraphs, and conclusion. Cohesive devices are used, but sometimes inappropriately or inconsistently, affecting the flow. Paragraphing is generally adequate, but could be strengthened with more explicit topic sentences and transitions.",
  "lexicalResource": "The vocabulary is adequate for the task, but lacks sophistication and range. There are some instances of inaccurate word choice. The use of synonyms and more formal vocabulary would enhance the essay.",
  "grammaticalRangeAccuracy": "The essay demonstrates a limited range of grammatical structures, and grammatical errors are frequent, affecting clarity. There are errors in verb tense, subject-verb agreement, article use, and sentence structure. More accurate and varied sentence structures are needed.",
